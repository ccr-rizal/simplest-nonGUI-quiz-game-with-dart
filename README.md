# simplest-nonGUI-quiz-game-with-dart
 Private Updated 2 minutes ago  I was just trying to learn the oops. While learning about the classes, I tried to make a simple executive file in which I can ask questions to the users and give them marks for each question and report them the final score. I tried to manage this by putting the questions in different file to make the code more clear and light to look. Actually this is the main thing I am trying to learn. I mean I want to use the classes and map or any other data from one file to another.
